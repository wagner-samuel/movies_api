# Java III

We will now learn about how we can use Java to interact with the web, and
eventually build full-stack web applications.

Throughout this module, we will be building the backend for our Movies Project. 
It will have the functionality previously provided by our remixed Glitch server:

- It will expose the ```/movies``` endpoint which will allow 
  ```GET```, ```POST```, ```PUT```, and ```DELETE``` CRUD methods.

There is much more you will be able to add to the application, and the
description above is far from a complete application, but over the course of the
next few lessons, we will build out the described functionality.

**By the end of this module, you should be able to:**

- Use Java to create an application in order to serve movies data as JSON
- Use Java to interact with a MySQL database
- Alter your Movies Javascript frontend to make requests to your new backend.

**Understand:**

- The Model-View-Controller design pattern.
- The request-response lifecycle of HTTP requests
- How the dependencies of a project are managed with Maven

**Know How To:**

- Create servlets that are mapped to a URI
- Establish database connections and use connections to execute queries
- Use prepared statements to avoid SQL injection
- Serve data as JSON to meet business needs
- Deploy a backend application to make available for data consumption
