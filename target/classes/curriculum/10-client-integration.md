#Client Integration

###The final task in making your first 
###Full Stack Application is to integrate the backend with your client side application.

###Luckily, this is easily done!

####1. First, pull down your client side app from GitHub

####2. Simply replace your calls to:

        https://my-glitch.server.me/movies

####With:

        http://localhost:8080/movies

We may need to set the CORS mode to allow local-to-local requests to be made in your browser. Once we test, you will know quickly if this is an issue.

####4. Test your client-side Movies App!

This is often called a 'System Test' or 'End-To-End Test'.

Meaning, we are testing the integrity of our entire system from the UI to the Database as if we were a user.


>>>>>>#Congrats! You have built your first full-stack application!!!!!
