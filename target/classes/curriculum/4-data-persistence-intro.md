#Data Persistence and Retrieval

```
Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves.
    â€“ Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web.
```

Perhaps the most important thing we do in development of an application is store and retrieve data.

Data allows
- accountability
- accuracy
- insight and, **most** importantly,
- *progress*

Without data, our web application serves almost no useful purpose.
More consequentially, advancement of scientific and intellectual goals in the 21st Century cannot be achieved without arduous labor.

Thankfully, we have well-designed and thoughtful patterns on how to store and retrieve data!
